<p style="margin-top: 50px;">
    
    I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in biology as a dynamic process. I am a strong supporter of theory-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical and synthesis techniques to reduce animal experimentation. Currently, I use a combination of wet and dry lab techniques to investigate in rodents how stress in early life affects the connectivity between brain areas, ultimately leading to changes in behavior. To me, the only possible science is Open.
