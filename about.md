<h1>About </h1>

![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">
    
    I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in biology as a dynamic process. I am a strong supporter of theory-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical and synthesis techniques to reduce animal experimentation. Currently, I use a combination of wet and dry lab techniques to investigate in rodents how stress in early life affects the connectivity between brain areas, ultimately leading to changes in behavior. To me, Science can only be <b>Open</b>.

<h3>Research experience</h3>
    I have been involved in research projects since 2013. During various internships and my PhD, I learnt not only different techniques, topics and methodologies, but most and formost how different people think and do science. Ultimately, these sprouted my interest in theories, quantitative biology and statistics.
