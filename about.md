<h1>About </h1>

![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})


<br><br>
I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in biology as a dynamic process. I am a strong supporter of theory-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical and synthesis techniques to reduce animal experimentation. Currently, I use a combination of wet and dry lab techniques to investigate in rodents how stress in early life affects the connectivity between brain areas, ultimately leading to changes in behavior. To me, Science can only be **Open**.

<h3>Research experience</h3>

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/research.svg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left;" />

Prior to my PhD, I have been involved in several research projects on the general topic of "stress". I have gained experience in *in vivo* as well as *in vitro* applied research. Ultimately, I became more interested in analysis and modelling, and I further specialized in meta-research, bioinformatics and Bayesian statistics.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/teaching.svg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left;" >

During my PhD, I have supervised 6 (+3 co-supervision) students for internship/theses. I have given several lectures in Bachelor and Master Neuroscience and Ethics courses, developed biology course material, and supervised students during practicals (small-group teaching). 
Currently, I am working towards a teaching qualification for higher education (BKO, *Basiskwalificatie Onderwijs*).
