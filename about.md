<h1>About </h1>

![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in the effects of stress on the brain and the body. I am a strong supporter of hypothesis-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical and synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis) techniques to reduce animal experimentation. Currently, I use a combination of wet and dry lab techniques to investigate in rodents how stress in early life affects the connectivity between brain areas, ultimately leading to changes in behavior.</p>
