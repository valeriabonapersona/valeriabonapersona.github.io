<p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px">Relacs is a unique consortium that collects and re-analyzes rodent data on the effects of early life adversity (ELA) on learning and memory. Funded in April 2019, 6 laboratories around the globe have already donated their pilot and (un)published data.  </p>


<h2>Unprecedented, groundbreaking research </h2>
<p>Such unique collaboration is unprecedented and it is at the forefront of a new, collaborative and open science. At Relacs, we are fully committed to investigate what ELA causes to behavior. </p>

<p>The pletora of factors that play a role in ELA hinders our ability to ground conclusive remarks on repricable and reproducible results. For this, we need your help. </p>

<p >By combining the existent data of multiple laboratories on the effects of ELA on memory after non-stressful learning, we aim to identify:</p>
<ul class="skill-list" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
	<li>Robust and reliable effects </li>
	<li>Sources of variability within and across laboratories</li>
	<li>Differences between males and females</li>
	<li>Characteristics of vulnerable and resilient individuals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Join the consortium!</h2>
We are currently including:
<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Adult, male and female, mice and rats</li>
	<li>Object in location, Object recognition, Object in context behavioral tasks</li>
	<li>Animals without early life adversity (e.g. controls from other types of experiments)</li>
	<li>Control & early life adversity experiments (limited nesting and bedding model)</li>
</ul>
Pilots and (un)published studies are welcome!
