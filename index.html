<p style="margin-top: 50px; text-align = center;">
I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in biology as a dynamic process.
I am a strong supporter of theory-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical 
and synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis) techniques to reduce animal experimentation.
