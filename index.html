<p style="margin-top: 50px;">
I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in the effects of stress on the brain and body.
I am a strong supporter of theory-driven research, and I am passionate about the use of statistical 
and synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis) techniques to reduce animal experimentation. Currently, I use a 
combination of wet and dry lab techniques to investigate in rodents how stress in early life affects 
the connectivity between brain areas, ultimately leading to changes in behavior.
