Playing classical music with the piano has been my first true love, and the first way in which I learnt how to explore my creativity. 
Music is not that different from Science. It requires skill, talent, rigor and perseverance, but also support and guidance. 
I graduated from the Conservatorium in 2016 (grade _9.5/10_) under the supervision and mentorship of M. Roberto Plano.
