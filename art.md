Playing classical music with the piano has been my first true love, and the first way in which I learnt how to explore my creativity. 
Music is not that different from Science. It requires skill, talent, rigor and perseverance, but also support and guidance. 
I graduated from the Conservatorium in 2016 (grade _9.5/10_) under the supervision and mentorship of <b>M. Roberto Plano</b>.

Yoga & Meditation

I practice meditation (Advaita philosophy) and Ashtanga yoga daily. As Science offers the possibility to discover the world 'outside', meditation 
is to me the discovery of the world 'inside'.

Gaia is a big inspiration for me. When she was born, I made her a <b>lullaby</b> - my first piece ever! To listen to it, click [here](/assets/Gaia.mp3). 
Big thanks to Dirk Jan Ardesh for recording with me.
