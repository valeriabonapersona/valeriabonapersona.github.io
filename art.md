Playing classical music with the piano has been my first true love, and the first way in which I learnt how to explore my creativity. 
Music is not that different from Science. It requires skill, talent, rigor and perseverance, but also support and guidance. 
I graduated from the Conservatorium in 2016 (grade _9.5/10_) under the supervision and mentorship of <b>M. Roberto Plano</b>.

Drawing of my little niece, Gaia.

Gaia is a ig inspiration for me, so I also made her a <b>lullaby</b> for when she was born. To listen to it, click [here]({{site.url}}/assets/Gaia.mp3"). 
Big thanks to Dirk Jan Ardesh for recording with me.
